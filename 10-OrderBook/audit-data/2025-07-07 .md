# Protocol Summary

  The `OrderBook` contract is a peer-to-peer trading system designed for `ERC20` tokens like `wETH`, `wBTC`, and `wSOL`. Sellers can list tokens at their desired price in `USDC`, and buyers can fill them directly on-chain.

# Disclaimer

Bikapa Regmi makes all effort to find as many vulnerabilities in the code in the given time period, but holds no responsibilities for the findings provided in this document. A security audit by the team is not an endorsement of the underlying business or product. The audit was time-boxed and the review of the code was solely on the security aspects of the Solidity implementation of the contracts.

# Risk Classification

|            |        | Impact |        |     |
| ---------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | --- |
|            |        | High   | Medium | Low |
|            | High   | H      | H/M    | M   |
| Likelihood | Medium | H/M    | M      | M/L |
|            | Low    | M      | M/L    | L   |

We use the [CodeHawks](https://docs.codehawks.com/hawks-auditors/how-to-evaluate-a-finding-severity) severity matrix to determine severity. See the documentation for more details.

# Audit Details

## Roles

1. Seller - Who lists his order on the platform
2. buyer - Who buys the wrapped tokens giving usdc
3. Owner - Owner of the contract

# Executive Summary
I have spended 5 hr auditing codes and found only 2 vulnerability.

# Findings

## Lows

### [L-1] The `_owner` shadows the state variable on `Ownable` contract.

**Description :** The constructor in `OrderBook` contract takes an argument of _owner and assigns that `_owner` to `Ownable` constructor. However, the `Ownable` contract uses `_ownable` address as a state variable. This affects the code readiability and clarity for those who reads code casually.
 
 **Recommended Mitigation :**
```diff
-     constructor(address _weth, address _wbtc, address _wsol, address _usdc, address _owner) Ownable(_owner) { }

+     constructor(address _weth, address _wbtc, address _wsol, address _usdc, address _initialOwner) Ownable   (_initialOwner) { }   
```

## Gas

### [G-1] Public variable not used internally.

If a function is marked public but is not used internally, consider marking it as `external`.
