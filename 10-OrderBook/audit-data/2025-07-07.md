### [L-1] The `_owner` shadows the state variable on `Ownable` contract.

**Description :** The constructor in `OrderBook` contract takes an argument of _owner and assigns that `_owner` to `Ownable` constructor. However, the `Ownable` contract uses `_ownable` address as a state variable. This affects the code readiability and clarity for those who reads code casually.
 
 **Recommended Mitigation :**
```diff
-     constructor(address _weth, address _wbtc, address _wsol, address _usdc, address _owner) Ownable(_owner) { }

+     constructor(address _weth, address _wbtc, address _wsol, address _usdc, address _initialOwner) Ownable   (_initialOwner) { }   
```

## Gas

### [G-1] Public variable not used internally.

If a function is marked public but is not used internally, consider marking it as `external`.
