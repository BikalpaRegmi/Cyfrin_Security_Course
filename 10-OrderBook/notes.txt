OrderBook is a simple protocol that follows orderbook principle unlike AMM. This protocol deals with wbtc,weth and wsol. Sellers can list their token in desired usdc price 
and anyone can buy it. Like Binance p2p.

Flow -:
i. Seller lock their wrapped token and list it on platform in desired price & deadline.
ii. Buyers buy the token by paying usdc.
iii. If the order isn't accepted by anyone before deadline, seller can cancel the order & retrive back thier tokens.

The each order contain an unique orderId giving the seller full control over thier listings. And the protocol uses SafeErc20 for secure transfers.

Users can cancel the active as well as expired orders. Users can ammend(Modify,edit) the active orders. Protocol also allows quick withdrawls for non-supported tokens like 
(Link,Uni,Dai) etc. But supported tokens(wbtc,weth,wsol) are not withdrawalable.
